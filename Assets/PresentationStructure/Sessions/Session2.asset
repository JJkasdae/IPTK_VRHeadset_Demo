  _description: "- Now, let\u2019s talk about Mercury, the closest planet to the
    sun. Despite being so close, Mercury surprisingly does not have the highest temperatures
    among the planets. Mercury is the second densest planet in the Solar System,
    though it is also the smallest planet.\n- Next, let\u2019s take a look at Venus.
    Venus is actually hotter than Mercury, even though it is farther away from the
    Sun. One interesting fact about Venus is that a day on this planet is longer
    than its entire year! The surface temperature on Venus is a scorching 462\xB0C.
    Additionally, Venus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky after
    the Moon.\n- Now, let\u2019s move on to Earth, our home, which is the third planet
    from the sun. Earth is the only planet we know of that has an atmosphere containing
    free oxygen, vast oceans of water, and, of course, life. It has a diameter of
    roughly 8,000 miles, or 13,000 kilometers, and its round shape is due to gravity
    pulling matter into a ball.\n- Now, let\u2019s move on to Mars, the fourth planet
    from the Sun and the second smallest in the Solar System. Mars is often called
    the \"Red Planet\" because its iron-rich dust gives the landscape a rusty-red
    color. The gravity on Mars is only 38% of Earth's. So, if you weigh 60 pounds
    on Earth, you\u2019d only weigh about 23 pounds on Mars.\n- Finally, let's talk
    about Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
    Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system. Despite its enormous
    size, Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets, rotating on its axis once
    every 9 hours and 55 minutes."
